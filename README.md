We used XPP-Auto software to do bifurcation analysis of the mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock. After modification of the original KM model, we used MATLAB to optimize the parameter values with certain criteria, and we compared the circadian oscillation region of mathematical models including different feedback loops.

1. ODE files are listed under "XPP_ODE" folder.
2. Research records and testing memos are located under "Doc" folder.
3. Tutorial and guide of using XPP-Auto can either be found in the originial software website [XPP](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html) or under "Doc\Xpp Tutorial and Guide\" and "Doc\XPP Running Memo"

Analyical calculation of Hopf bifurcation points MATLAB code for the optimization of parameters can be found in the main text of SI of the original paper.
